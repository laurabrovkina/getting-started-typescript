// Exercise: Typing Objects in TypeScript

// Question 1: Create an object literal representing a book with the following properties:
// - title: string
// - author: string
// - pages: number

// Question 2: If you try adding another property to the object literal book object, does TypeScript allow it?

// Question 3: Define an interface `Car` with the following properties:
// - make: string
// - model: string
// - year: number
// Then, create an object that conforms to this interface.

// Question 4: Define a type alias called `Car2` with the same shape as `Car`.
// Then, create an object that conforms to this type alias.

// Question 5: Create an interface called `Car3` with the same shape as `Car`,
// but allow any additional properties to be added.
