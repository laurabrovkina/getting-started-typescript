# What you'll learn in this course

In this course, we'll cover TypeScript basics, from scratch including primitive types, arrays, tuples, enums, interfaces, functions, classes, modules and more.

## Who is the course for?

This course is for JavaScript developers who want to learn TypeScript. I assume you're already familiar with modern JavaScript. TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript, so it's important you understand JavaScript well first before taking this course.

If you're already familiar with TypeScript, you may also find this course useful to round out your knowledge of or as a refresher.

We'll also use Node, npm, and Bun, but if you're new to these, don't worry. We don't do anything complex with these, and I'll explain everything you need to know.
