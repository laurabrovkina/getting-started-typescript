// 1. Define an enum called Direction with four possible values: Up, Down, Left, Right

// 2. Create a function called `move` that takes a Direction enum as an argument and uses a switch to return a corresponding string like "Moving up!"

// 3. Define an enum called Status with explicit values: Success = 1, Failure = -1, Pending = 0

// 4. Create a function called getStatusMessage that accepts the Status enum as an argument and returns a corresponding message like "Operation was successful! or "Operation failed!"

// 5. Implement the same feature, but this time use a object literal instead of an enum

// 6. Create a function called getStatusMessageLiteral that accepts the statusLiteral as an argument and returns a corresponding message
