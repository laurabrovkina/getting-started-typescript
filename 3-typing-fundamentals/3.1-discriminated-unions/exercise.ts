// Define a Vehicle type using discriminated union.
// The type should have two possible shapes: car or truck.
// The car shape should have a numberOfDoors property.
// The truck shape should have a payloadCapacity property
// Write a function `describeVehicle` that accepts a Vehicle and returns a string describing the vehicle.
// The function should return "A car with X doors." for car shapes,
// "A truck with a payload capacity of Y." for truck shapes

// Test cases
// const car: Vehicle = { kind: "car", numberOfDoors: 4 };
// const truck: Vehicle = { kind: "truck", payloadCapacity: 2000 };

// console.log(describeVehicle(car)); // Should print the description of the car
// console.log(describeVehicle(truck)); // Should print the description of the truck
