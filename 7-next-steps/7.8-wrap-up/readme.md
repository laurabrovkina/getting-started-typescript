# Wrap up

Congratulations! You now have a solid foundation in TypeScript.

If your team is converting an existing app to TypeScript, or starting a new project in TypeScript, I can help. Or, if your team is interested in a live TypeScript workshop, let me know! I've helped many teams transition to TypeScript.

We covered a lot of ground, but this course is just the beginning. In the next course, we'll dive deeper into TypeScript. You'll learn:

- How to write flexible, type-safe code that works with many different types via generics
- How to configure TypeScript's tsconfig for different projects
- See how to validate data at runtime and derive types from runtime schemas
- Linting TypeScript to catch common mistakes and enforce coding standards
- Implementing types via jsdoc comments
- Utility types for creating new types from existing types
- Techniques for narrowing types
- How to use TypeScript with popular libraries and frameworks like React and Node.js

Thanks for watching.
