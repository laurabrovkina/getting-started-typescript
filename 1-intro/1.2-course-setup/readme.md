# Course setup

I've provided a repository that contains the code for this course at https://github.com/Dometrain/getting-started-typescript. Clone this repository to follow along.

After cloning the repository, open the project in your editor. You should see the following file structure.

Each lesson has a corresponding directory. For example, the first lesson is in the `1-intro` directory, so open this directory in your editor to follow along.

## Extensions

I'm also using the [Twoslash Query Comments](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Orta.vscode-twoslash-queries) extension to display types inline in the code. You don't need this to follow along, but I'm sharing this in case you find it useful for documenting TypeScript types.
